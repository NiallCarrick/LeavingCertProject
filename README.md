# LeavingCertProject
My Computer Science project for the 2024 Leaving Certificate, 

The requirement for the project was to create an artefact which could in some way improve mental health/wellbeing.
I created a program which would use a microbit to measure daily screen time, excercise and time slept, read that data into a python GUI program which would then show graphs and make predictions based on that data.

Brief for the project can be found here: https://blob-static.studyclix.ie/static/content/file/attachments/8/85b32a30-e18b-4aa4-9019-57248a00ccd4/Coursework%20Brief%202024.pdf
