            <h3>Development of the Artefact</h3>
            
            <p>This artefact was created using 
                the BBC Microbit to take in and record data and 
                then python was used to process the data and make predictions based on it.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <h4><b>Microbit</b></h4>
                <li>
                    I first started by creating a Microbit program which would 
                    log data and output it to a csv file on a PC. 
                    I did this by using the Data Logger extension on the BBC Microbit.
                </li>
                <li>I used this extension to log three pieces of data: 
                    the amount of physical activity during a day, 
                    the amount of screen time during the day and the time slept that day.
                </li>
                <img src="img/create18.PNG" alt="">
                <li>The program would log when the user went to sleep and when they woke up and through that find the time slept that night.</li>
                <li>The program would also warn the user of excessive screen time and of not enough physical activity as well as congratulating them on moderate screen time and greater physical activity.</li>
                <h4><b>Analyis Program</b></h4>
                <li>Then I began on the python program to read in and analyze this data.</li>
                <li>I used the csv library to read in the data.</li>
                    <img src="img/create1.PNG" alt="">
                <li>I began to create the different functions to analyze and make predictions on the data.</li>
                <li>I used matplotlib and numpy to output useful graphs of the data.</li>
                    <img src="img/create2.PNG" alt="">
                    <img src="img/create3.PNG" alt="">
                <li><b>Example:</b></li>
                    <img src="img/create4.PNG" alt="">
                    <img src="img/create5.PNG" alt="">
                    <img src="img/create6.PNG" alt="">

                <li>I used sci-kit learn to make predictions based on the data.</li>
                <li>The function would take in the value of one of the pieces of data and make a prediction of the value of another piece of data based on it.
                </li>
                <li>Example:</li>
                <img src="img/create8.PNG" alt="">
                <li>This function takes in a value of screen time and time spent physically active in a day and then attempts to predict the time slept that night. </li>
                <br>
                <li>I then created a basic menu system in the console:</li>
                <img src="img/create9.PNG" alt="">

                <h4><b>Graphical User Interface</b></h4>
                <li>At this point in the development of the artefact I was behind schedule and so had time to spare, therefore I decided to try and implement a Graphical User Interface.</li>
                <li>To do this I used a third party python library called customtkinter.</li>
                <img src="img/create10.PNG" alt="">
                <li>After setting the colour scheme and creating the basic frame I created a dropdown menu which allowed the user to select different graphs of the data.</li>
                <img src="img/create19.PNG" alt="">
                <img src="img/create11.PNG" alt="">
                <img src="img/create12.PNG" alt="">
                <br><br>
                <li>I then implemented the predictive element into the GUI:</li>
                <img src="img/create13.PNG" alt="">
                <img src="img/create14.PNG" alt="">
                <img src="img/create15.PNG" alt="">
                <li>The user can select which value they want to predict and then enter the corresponding values to predict based on, the interface then outputs the predicted result below.</li>
                <br><br>

                <li>I also implemented a button which would open a file dialog, allowing the user to open a csv file with the data they wish to read in.</li>
                <img src="img/create16.PNG" alt="">
                <li>This file dialog was implemented using customtkinter.</li>
                <img src="img/create20.PNG" alt="">
                <br><br>
                <li>Finally, I then implemented a screen which would appear in the GUI if no data had been read in and prompt the user to select the data to read in.</li>
                <img src="img/create17.PNG" alt="">
            </ul>
