                <h3>Idea 1:</h3>
                <h4>Sleep Tracker.</h4>

                <h5>Basic Requirements:</h5>
                Create an artefact using an embedded system that will measure the amount of time slept by the user as well as other relevant data such as the amount of physical activity, screen time and what time they went to sleep.
                
                <h5>Advanced:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The artefact should allow the user to view useful graphs corresponding to the data recorded.</li>
                    <li>The artefact should contain a model which will allow the users to make predictions in relation to their sleep, screen time and physical activity.</li>
                    <li>The artefact should warn the user of excessive screen time use and of lack of sleep and physical activity, therfore aiming to improve the user's wellbeing.</li>
                    <li>The user should be able to view useful information and trends in the data recorded.</li>
                    <li>The user should be able to see if there is a correlation in the data recorded.</li>
                </ul>
                
                    
                <h5>Target Users</h5>
                People who have trouble sleeping and are looking to improve their sleeping habits.

                    
                <h5>Social Implications</h5>
                This project could help to reduce the issue of excessive screen time use.

                
                <h5>Equipment Needed:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Micro-bit</li>

                <h3>Idea 2:</h3>
                <h4>Sunlight hours mood tracker</h4>

                <h5>Basic Requirements:</h5>
                Create an artefact which will keep track  the amount of sunlight hours per day and the mood of the user each day.

                <h5>Advanced:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow the user to see if there is a correlation between sunlight and mood.</li>
                    <li>Allow the user to make preidctions based on the data. </li>
                    <li>Show relevant graphs of the data</li>
                </ul>
                
                    
                <h5>Target Users</h5>
                Sufferers of seasonal depression and people who are unsure of the cause of their mood.
                    
                <h5>Social Implications</h5>
                It could help to inform people of a possible future mood change, allowing them to prepare themselves beforehand and take preventative measures.
                
                <h5>Equipment Needed:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Micro-bit</li>
                    <li>Light sensor</li>

                <h3>Idea 3:</h3>
                <h4>Health tracking system</h4>

                <h5>Basic Requirements:</h5>
                Create an artefact which will record and keep track of the biometrics and overall health of the user.

                <h5>Advanced:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow the user to see trends in the users activity and other useful biometric information such as: heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
                    <li>Warn the user of a predicted spike in heart rate or blood pressure or of predicted future ill health.</li>
                </ul>
                
                    
                <h5>Target Users</h5>
                People who have experienced poor health and health issues in the past who want to keep track of their overall health and recognize patterns and trends in their health.
                    
                <h5>Social Implications</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>An artefact such as this could help many users to identify patterns of stress and concerning trends in their health, it could help to predict users of future ill health.</li>
                    <li>This could in turn help to reduce the chances of sudden illness and reduce the stress on Health Services.

                <h3>Chosen Idea:</h3>
                <h4>Idea 1: Sleep Tracker</h4>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>I sent a survey around my school which asked which of the three above ideas most people would wish to have, the Sleep Tracker was by far the most popular of the three projects.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Therfore, out of the above ideas, I have chosen to proceed with Idea 1,
                        the "Sleep Tracker". Though I would have enjoyed using Ideas 2 or 3, 
                        I believe that  the "Sunlight hours mood tracker" would be too abstract as it is extremely difficult to accurately measure something as intangible as mood.
                        The "Health tracking system" may also be too complex to complete in the time given. </li>
                    <li>The artefact should be able to, within a reasonable degree of error, keep track of and predict sleep time as well as factors affecting it.</li>
                    <li>The artefact should output useful statistical information and graphs which will help to keep the user informed of changes in their sleep and its factors.</li>
                    
                </ul>
