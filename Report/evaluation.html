            Over the course of the development of this project, through various difficulties I tried my best to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the brief.

            <h3>What went well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I was able to read in the data and output useful graphs and predictions based on it, using python libraries such as csv,numpy,pandas,matplotlib and sci-kitlearn. 
                    Through this I met  Advanced Requirement 1, which required me to predict future values based on a previously recorded dataset. 
                    The graphs of the dataset also satisfied Advanced Requirement 3, the element of the brief which required the user to be able to view the recorded data in a graphical format.
                </li>
                <li>These predictions also satisfied Basic Requirement 3, as they provided analysis on the data which allowed the user to inform decisions based on wellbeing in the future.</li>
                <li>The predictions allowed us to ansert certain 'what if' questions, revealing that increased physical activity helps to increase time slept and that screen time is harmful to sleep time.</li>
                <li>These 'what if' questions involved three parameters, the sleep time, screen time and physically activity, this satisfied Advanced Requirement 2.</li>
                <br>

                <li>The micro-bit worked as a fully automated embedded sytem.
                    The micro-bit also utilised both digital inputs and outputs, supporting the theme of wellbeing 
                    by encouraging the user to spend less time on screens and more physically active. Therefore Basic Requirement 1 as well as Basic Requirement 3 was satisfied.
                </li>


                <li>The micro-bit worked to record and store the gathered data of the screen time and physical activity. This satisfied Basic Requirement 2. </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    I had enough time left over for the create section of the project which allowed me to implement the program into a graphical user interface.
                    I was quite happy with the overall quality of the interface.
 
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>I believe that I satisfactorily met the needs of the projects end users, the program is easy to use and provides a wide array of functions in relation to health and wellbeing.
                    The user is able to view data relating to their health in a graphical format and are able to use the program to make predictions in relation to their sleep and therefore inform future decisions on their health and wellbeing.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h3>How I could have improved the project</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If I had more time to work on the artefact I would have implemented more features to the project and made several changes such as: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allowing the user to view more statistics and data such as the correlation coefficient between two of the variables or the slope of the line of best fit.</li>
                        <li>The GUI could have been made more animated and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
                        <li>The python program could have been packaged into an executable file. I wished to do this, however there were several issues with the various third party libraries and I did not have time to solve them.</li>
                        <li>I could have implemented more variables of different data types to be taken into account with calculating the sleep time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Overall, I was mostly happy with the state of the finished artefact, I believe that the project fulfilled the various requirements to a satisfactory degree and that the artefact met the needs of the end users and that the project can help to promote health and wellbeing by seeking to improve sleeping habits.</li>
            </ul>
